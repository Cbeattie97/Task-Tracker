# Kanban Board Task Tracker

## Description

This task tracker was created to provide a visual aid for managing multiple tasks, updating their progress from 'To-Do', 'In Progress' and 'Complete' using a drag and drop method. Tasks created will display yellow when approaching their due date and red when overdue. Task cards are to be stored using local storage as for progress not to be lost upon the page reloading.
